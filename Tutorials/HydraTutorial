Tutorial: Brute-Forcing SSH Credentials Using Hydra
Objective
Demonstrate how to set up a test environment to perform a brute-force attack on an SSH
server using Hydra on Kali Linux.
What is a Brute-Force Attack?
  • Definition: A brute-force attack is a method used to gain unauthorized access to a
  system or data by systematically guessing every possible combination of passwords
  or encryption keys.
  • Effectiveness: It can be effective if the password is weak or the key space is small.
  • Example:
1. Suppose a password is a 4-digit numeric code.
2. The attacker tries combinations: 0000, 0001, 0002... up to 9999.
3. When the correct combination is found, access is granted.
  • Drawbacks:
  o It is slow, especially for complex passwords.
  o Systems often have protections like account lockouts or rate-limiting to
mitigate brute-force attempts.
What is Hydra?
  • Definition: Hydra is a versatile tool used for performing brute-force attacks on
  various protocols and services, such as SSH, FTP, HTTP, and more.
  • Use Case: It is often used by penetration testers to test the strength of passwords
  on target systems.
  • Key Features:
  o Supports a wide range of protocols.
  o Can use custom username and password lists.
  o Multithreaded, allowing it to test multiple combinations simultaneously for
  faster results.
Prerequisites
1. Two virtual machines:
  o Kali Linux (attacker)
  o Debian (victim)
2. SSH service installed and running on the Debian VM.
3. Hydra installed on Kali Linux (pre-installed in most distributions).
4. Basic knowledge of terminal commands and Linux system administration.
Steps
1. Set Up the Environment
1. Create a Test User on Debian VM:
  o Login to your Debian VM.
  o Create a user with the command: sudo adduser <username>
  o Assign a simple password (e.g., password).
  o Using sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> give the user sudo
  o Grab the ip address using ip address
2. Install and Start SSH Services on Both VMs:
  o Install SSH using: sudo apt update
  o sudo apt install openssh-server
  o If SSH is already installed, check its status:
sudo systemctl status ssh

  o Start the SSH service:
sudo systemctl start ssh
2. The Attack
1. Dictionary Files:
  o Kali Linux includes dictionaries like rockyou.txt and fasttrack.txt. These can
be found in /usr/share/wordlists/.
  o  Navigate to the wordlists directory (for this tutorial, use fasttrack.txt).
2. Create a Username List (Optional):
  o To test multiple usernames, create a usernames.txt file:
sudo nano usernames.txt
Add your desired usernames in the file.
3. Perform the Brute-Force Attack:
  o On the Kali machine, run the command:
hydra -l <username> -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
ssh://<Debian_VM_IP> -V -I -F
  o Explanation of Flags:
  ▪ -l: Specifies the username.
  ▪ -P: Specifies the password dictionary.
  ▪ ssh://: Indicates the protocol to attack.
  ▪ -V: Displays login + password attempts.
  ▪ -L: Specifies the file of usernames (use -L usernames.txt if testing
  multiple usernames).
  ▪ -t <num_of_threads>: Adds threads to improve performance.
4. The Exploit:
  o Hydra will display the valid username-password combination, highlighted in
  the output.
  o Use the discovered credentials to log in via SSH:
  ssh <username>@<Debian_VM_IP>
  o Once logged in, access or create any files you need.
